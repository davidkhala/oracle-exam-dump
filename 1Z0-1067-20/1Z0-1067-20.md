	```
	Error: Missing item separator 
		on vcn_peer_lab.tf line 15, in resource "oci_core_security_list" "ManagementSecurityList": 15 tcp_options = (min = "22", max = "22")
	Expected a comma to mark the beginning of the next item.
	```
	You locate the related code block in the Terraform config and find the following:
	(11)	ingress_security_rules {
	(12)	protocol = 6
	(13)	source = "0.0.0.0/0"
	(14)
	(15)	tcp_options = [min = "22", max = "22"]
	(16)	}
	Which correction should you make to solve this issue?

	- [x] Modify line 15 to be the following: `tcp_options {min="22", max="22"}`
	- [ ] Modify line 15 to be the following: `tcp_options = {min="22", max="22"}`
	- [ ] Place a command at the end of line 16
- You are a cloud operations administrator who has recently joined a new department. You have created 10 Terraform stacks using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) resource manager. Each stack creates a different set of resources in OCI for your development team. 

	What determines the cost of these Terraform stacks?
	- [ ] The cost for each stack will be higher for pay as you go (PAYG) than for monthly flex billing.
	- [ ] The length of time it takes to build each resource using these Terraform stacks
	- [x] Resource manager stacks are free but you are charged for the resources they create.
- You have created an Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) service in your company's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) tenancy and you now have to load historical data into it. You have already extracted this historical data from multiple data marts and data warehouses. This data is stored in CSV text files these file are ranging in size from 25 MB to 20 GB.

	Which step is most efficient and error tolerant method for loading data into ADW?
	- [ ] Create Auth token, use it to create an object storage credential by executing DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL, using OCI CLI upload the CSV files to an OCI object storage bucket, create the tables in the ADW database and then execute Data Pump Import for each CSV file to copy the contents into the corresponding ADW database table.
	- [ ] Create Auth token, use it to create an object storage credential by executing DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL, using the web console upload the CSV files to an OCI object storage bucket, create the tables in the ADW database and then execute DBMS_CLOUD.COPY_DATA for each CSV file to copy the contents into the corresponding ADW database table.
	- [x] Create Auth token, use it to create an object storage credential by executing DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL, using OCI CLI upload the CSV files to an OCI object storage bucket, create the tables in the ADW database and then execute DBMS_CLOUD.COPY_DATA for each CSV file to copy the contents into the corresponding ADW database table.
	- [ ] Create the tables in the ADW database and then execute SQL* Loader for each CSV file to load the contents into the corresponding ADW database table.

- You are helping a customer to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Resource Manager to automate their infrastructure. Which of the below options is FALSE regarding Resource Manager?

	- [x] With Resource Manager, you cannot execute scripts or commands on a remote computer.
	- [ ] For a given Resource Manager stack, only one job can be run at a time. 

- Your company recently adopted a hybrid cloud architecture which requires them to migrate some of their on-premises web applications to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). You created a Terraform template which automatically provisions OCI resources such as compute instances. load balancer and a database instance.
	After running the stack using the terraform apply command, it successfully launched the compute instances and the load balancer, but it failed to create a new database instance with the following error:
	`Service error: NotAuthorizedOrNotFound. shape VM.Standard2.4 not found, http status code: 404`
	You discovered that the resource quotas assigned to your compartment prevent you from using VM.Standard2.4 instance shapes available in your tenancy. You edit the Terraform script and replace the shape with VM.Standard 2.2
	Which options would you recommend to re-run the terraform command to have required OCI resources provisioned with the least effort?
	- [ ] `terraform apply -target=oci_database_db_system.db_system`
	- [x] `terraform apply -auto-approve`
	- [ ] `terraform plan -target=oci_database_db_system.db_system`

- You deployment platform within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) leverages a compute instance with multiple block volumes attached. There are multiple teams that use the same compute instance and have access to these block volumes. You want to ensure that no one accidentally deletes of these block volumes. You have started to construct the following IAM policy but need to determine which permissions should be used.

	```
	allow group DeploymentUsers to manage volume-family where ANY {
		request.permission != <???>,

		- suspicious on not choosing D
## Budget, usage and quota
- You have a group of developers who launch multiple VM.Standard2.2 compute instances every day into the compartment `Dev`. As a result your OCI tenancy quickly hit the service limit for this shape. Other groups can no longer create new instances using VM.Standard2.2 shape. From this, your company has issued a new mandate that the `Dev` compartment must include a quota to allow for use of only 20 VM.standard shapes per availability domain.
	Your solution should not affect any other compartment in the tenancy.
	Which quota statement should be used to implement this new requirement?
	- [ ] 	```
			zero compute quotas in tenancy
			set compute quota vm-standard2-2-count to 20 in tenancy
			```
	- [ ]	```
			zero compute quotas in tenancy
			set compute quota vm-standard2-2-count to 20 in compartment dev
			```
	- [x]	```

	You check your instance pool configuration to confirm that the maximum number of instances is configured to allow 20 compute instances. Currently 14 compute instances have been provisioned by the instance pool. You also confirm that current CPU utilization across all hosts exceed the scale-threshold you set in your auto-scaling policy. However, the instance pool is not provisioning any new instances. 

	What can you check to determine why the application is NOT functioning properly?
	- [ ] Verify that the database is accessible
	- [ ] Verify that the Quality Assurance team is not currently performing load-testing against production. 
	- [ ] Verify that the new offer feature code did not introduce any performance bugs.
	- [x] Verify that the compute resource has not been exceeded.

- You have recently joined a startup company and quickly find that nobody is tracking the amount of money spent on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Seeing an opportunity to help save money you begin creating a solution to better track the cost of resources provisioned by each individual on the team.
	Which option allows you to identify excessive spend across all resources in your tenancy?
	- [x] Create a budget for each compartment that will send a notification when monthly spend reaches a pre-defined amount.
	- [ ] Use the Events Service and create rules that will act when a new Object Storage bucket or Compute Instance has been created. Have the rule email you each time one of these events occurs.
	- [ ] Create a tag namespace named `BILLING` with a Tag Key named `CostCenter`. Tag each of your resources with this Tag Key and the correct value.
	- [ ] Use the Python SDK to write a custom application that will monitor the Audit Log. Look for CREATE events and configure the application to send you an email each time a new resource is created.

- Multiple teams are sharing a tenancy in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). You are asked to figure out an appropriate method to manage OCI cost. 
	Which is NOT a valid technique to accurately attribute costs to resources sued by each team?
	- [ ] Define and use tags for resources used by each team. Analyze usage data from the OCI Usage Report which has detailed information about resource and tags.
	- [x] Create an Identity and Access Management (IAM) group for each team. Create an OCI budget for each group to track spending.

	- [x] `oci os object copy --namespace-name <object-storage-namespace> --bucket-name <source-bucket-name> --source-object-name <source-object> --destination-namespace <destination-namespace-string> --destination-region <destination-region> --destination-bucket <destination-bucket-name> --destination-object-name <destination-object-name>`
	- [ ] `oci os object copy --source-compartment-id <source-compartment-id> --bucket-name <source-bucket-name> --source-object-name <source-object> --destination-compartment-id <destination-compartment-id> --destination-region <destination-region> --destination-bucket <destination-bucket-name> --destination-object-name <destination-object-name>`
	- [ ] `oci os object copy --bucket-name <source-bucket-name> --source-object-name <source-object> --destination-compartment-id <destination-compartment-id> --destination-region <destination-region> --destination-bucket <destination-bucket-name> --destination-object-name <destination-object-name>`  

- Your application is using Object Storage bucket named `app-data` in the namespace `vision`, to store both persistent and temporary data. Every week all the temporary data should be deleted to limit the storage consumption. 

Currently you need to navigate to the Object Storage page using the web console, select the appropriate bucket to view all the objects and delete the temporary ones.

To simplify the task you have configured the application to save all the temporary data with `/temp` prefix. You have also decide to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to perform this operation. 

What is the command you should use to speed up the data cleanup?
	- [ ] `oci os objectstorage bulk-delete -ns vision -bn app-data --prefix /temp --force`
	- [ ] `oci os object delete -ns vision -bn app-data --prefix /temp`

- You have created following JSON file to implement lifecycle policy for one of your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage buckets.
```
	oci os object-lifecycle-policy put -ns MyNamespace -bn MyBucket --items '[
		{
			"action": "ARCHIVE",
			"is-enabled":true,
			"name":"ArchiveAfter30Days",
			"object-name-filter":{
				"inclusion-prefixes":[
					"documents"
				]
			},
			"time-amount":30, 
			"time-unit":"DAYS"
		},
		{
			"action":"DELETE",
			"is-enabled":true,
			"name":"DeleteAfter180Days",
			"object-name-filter":{
				"inclussion-prefixes":null
			},
			"time-amount":180,
			"time-unit":"DAYS"
		}
	]'

```
	- [x] Objects containing name prefix 'documents' will automatically be moved from Standard Object Storage to Archive storage after 30 days and then deleted after 180 days from the date of creation.
	- [ ] Objects containing name prefix 'documents' will automatically be moved from Standard Object Storage to Archive storage after 30 days from the date of creation, but because of policy error have to be manually deleted after 180 days.
	- [ ] Objects containing name prefix 'documents' will automatically be moved from Standard Object Storage to Archive storage after 30 days from the date of creation. Other objects will be deleted after 180 days.
	- [ ] Objects containing name prefix 'documents' will automatically be moved from Standard Object Storage to Archive storage after 30 days from the date of creation

- You have been brought in to help secure and existing application that leverages Object Storage buckets to distribute content. The data is currently being shared from public buckets and the security team is not satisfied with the approach. They have stated that all data must be stored in storage buckets. Your application should be able to provide secure access to the data. The URL that is provided for access to the data must be rotated every 30 days. 

Which design option will meet these requirements?
	- [ ] Create a new group and map users to this group, create a IAM policy providing access to Object Storage service only to this group. Users can then simply login to OCI console and retrieve needed files.
	- [ ] Create a private bucket only to share the data.
	- [x] Use Pre-Authenticated request, even though there will be multiple URLs this will provide better security.
	- [ ] Create multiple bucket and classify them as Public and Private. Use public bucket for non-sensitive data and private bucket for sensitive data.

	- [ ] Advertise 192.168.10.10/32 router over FastConnect
	- [ ] Advertise 192.168.10.10/32 router over the VPN
	- [ ] The instance will communicate by default over IPSec VPN which ensures data is encrypted in-transit.
	- [ ] The instance will communicate by default over the FastConnect private virtual circuit which ensured data is encrypted in-transit

- You launched a Linux compute instance to host the new version of your company website via Apache Http server on Https (port 443). The instance is created in a public subnet along with other instances. The default security list associated to the subnet is:
	![](security-list.png)
	You want to allow access to the company website from public internet without exposing websites eventually hosted on the other instances in the public subnet.
	Which two actions should you do?
	- [x] Create a network security group, add a stateful rule to allow ingress access on port 443 and associate it to the instance that host the company website.
	- [ ] Create a network security group, add a stateful rule to allow ingress access on port 443 and associate it to the public subnet that host the company website.
	- [ ] In default security list, add a stateful rule to allow ingress access on port 443.
	- [ ] Create a new security list with a stateful rule to allow ingress access on port 443 and associate it to the public subnet
	- [x] Access the Linux instance via SSH and configure iptables to allow HTTPS access on port 443.
- You provisioned an Oracle Linux compute instance through the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) management console then immediately realize you add an SSH key file. You notice that OCI compute service provides instance console connections that supports adding SSH keys for a running instance. Hence, you created the console connection for your Linux server and activated it using the connection string provided. However, now you get prompted for a username and password to login.
	What option should you recommend to add the SSH key to your running instance, while minimizing the administrative overhead?
	- [ ] You need to terminate the running instance and recreate it by providing the SSH key file.
	- [ ] You need to configure the boot loader to use ttyS0 as a console terminal on the VM.
	- [x] You need to modify the serial console connection string to include the identity file flag, `-i` to specify the SSH key to use.
	- [ ] You need to reboot the instance from the console, boot into the bash shell in maintenance mode, and add SSh keys for the opc user
- You have a Linux compute instance located in a public subnet in a VCN which hosts a web application. The security list attached to subnet containing the compute instance has the following stateful ingress rule.
	![](ingress.png)
	Which step will resolve the issue?
	- [ ] In the route table, add a rule for your default traffic to be routed to NAT gateway.
	- [x] In the security list, add an ingress rule for port 80 (http)
	- [ ] In the route table, add a rule for your default traffic to be routed to service gateway.
	- [ ] In the security list, remove the ssh rule.
- You set up a bastion host in your VCN to only allow your IP address (140.19.2.140) to establish SSH connections to your Compute instances that are deployed private subnet. The compute instances have an attached Network Security Group with a Source: NSG-050504. To secure the bastion host, you added the following ingress rules to its Network Security Group
	```
	Type: 		All TCP
	Protocol:	TCP
	Port Range:	22
	Source:		140.19.2.140/32

	Type: 		All TCP
	Protocol: 	TCP
	Port Range:	22
	Source:		NSG-050504
	```
	However, after checking the bastion host logs, you discovered that there are IP addresses other than your own that can access your bastion host. What is the root cause of this issue?
	- [ ] The port 22 provides unrestricted access to 140.19.2.140 and to other IP address.
	- [x] All compute instances associated with NSG-050504 are also able to connect to the bastion host.
	- [ ] The Security List allows access to all IP address which overrides the Network Security Group ingress rules.
	- [ ] A net-mask of `/32` allows all IP address in the 140.19.2.0 network, other than your IP 110.19.2.140
