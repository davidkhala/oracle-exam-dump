## Terraform and OCI Resource Manager
- You run Terraform in your laptop.  After you provision an instance, you want to capture the IP address of the provisioned instance and save to a local file.
Which Terraform feature that you will use to accomplish the task?
	- [ ] Remote-exec provisioner
	- [x] Local-exec provisioner

- You are helping a customer to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Resource Manager to automate their infrastructure. Which of the below options is FALSE regarding Resource Manager?
	- [ ] Resource Manager consists of Terraform configuration files and each file are in HCL or JSON format.
	- [ ] To control access to the Terraform state file, you can create a security policy that limits access to reading jobs. 
	- [x] With Resource Manager, you cannot execute scripts or commands on a remote computer.
	- [ ] For a given Resource Manager stack, only one job can be run at a time. 

- Your company recently adopted a hybrid cloud architecture which requires them to migrate some of their on-premises web applications to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). You created a Terraform template which automatically provisions OCI resources such as compute instances. load balancer and a database instance.
	After running the stack using the terraform apply command, it successfully launched the compute instances and the load balancer, but it failed to create a new database instance with the following error:
	`Service error: NotAuthorizedOrNotFound. shape VM.Standard2.4 not found, http status code: 404`
	You discovered that the resource quotas assigned to your compartment prevent you from using VM.Standard2.4 instance shapes available in your tenancy. You edit the Terraform script and replace the shape with VM.Standard 2.2
	Which options would you recommend to re-run the terraform command to have required OCI resources provisioned with the least effort?
	- [ ] `terraform apply -target=oci_database_db_system.db_system`
	- [x] `terraform apply -auto-approve`
	- [ ] `terraform plan -target=oci_database_db_system.db_system`
	- [ ] `terraform refresh -target=oci_database_db_system.db_system`
## Compartment and IAM
- How can you provide user access to an existing compartment in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure?
	- [ ] by granting users access to the compartment when the compartment is created
	- [ ] by adding users to a compartment; all users in the compartment will have access to the resources in the compartment
	- [ ] by granting access directly to the user when the user is created
	- [x] by adding user to a group and defining policy to provide the group access to the compartment
## Budget, usage
- You have a group of developers who launch multiple VM.Standard2.2 compute instances every day into the compartment `Dev`. As a result your OCI tenancy quickly hit the service limit for this shape. Other groups can no longer create new instances using VM.Standard2.2 shape. From this, your company has issued a new mandate that the `Dev` compartment must include a quota to allow for use of only 20 VM.standard shapes per availability domain.
	Your solution should not affect any other compartment in the tenancy.
	Which quota statement should be used to implement this new requirement?
	- [ ] 	```
			zero compute quotas in tenancy
			set compute quota vm-standard2-2-count to 20 in tenancy
			```
	- [ ]	```
			zero compute quotas in tenancy
			set compute quota vm-standard2-2-count to 20 in compartment dev
			```
	- [x]	```
			set compute quota vm-standard2-2-count to 20 in compartment dev
			```
	- [ ]	```
			set compute quota vm-standard2-2-count to 20 in compartment dev where request.region=us-phoenix-1
			```
- You as an admin want to provide IAM group `FinanceAuditors` to analyze the spending in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy. Which of the below policy statement will you define?

	- [ ] `Allow group FinanceAuditors to read usage-cost in tenancy`
	- [x] `Allow group FinanceAuditors to read usage-reports in tenancy`
	- [ ] `Allow group FinanceAuditors to read spend-reports in tenancy`

	]'

```
	- [x] Objects containing name prefix 'documents' will automatically be moved from Standard Object Storage to Archive storage after 30 days and then deleted after 180 days from the date of creation.
	- [ ] Objects containing name prefix 'documents' will automatically be moved from Standard Object Storage to Archive storage after 30 days from the date of creation, but because of policy error have to be manually deleted after 180 days.
