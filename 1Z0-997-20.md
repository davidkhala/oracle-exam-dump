1. Your conrpany will soon start moving critical systems into Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform. These systems will reside in the us-phoenix-1 and us- ashbum-1 regions. As part of the migration planning, you are reviewing the company's existing security policies and written guidelines for the OCI platform usage within the company. Your security processes for critical systems require that all data is encrypted at rest using Customer-Managed Keys. Which two options ensure compliance with this policy? (Choose two.) 
    - [ ] You do not need to perform any additional actions because the OCI Block Volume service always encrypts all block volumes, boot volumes, and volume backups at rest by using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with 256-bit encryption. 
    - [x] When you create a new OCI Object Storage bucket through OCI console, you need to choose 'ENCRYPT USING CUSTOMER-MANAGED KEYS' option. 
    - [x] When you create a new block volume through OCI console, select 'Encrypt using Customer-Managed Keys' checkbox and use encryption keys generated and stored in OCI Vault. 
    - [ ] When you create a new compute instance through OCI console, you use the default options for 'configure boot volume' to speed up the process to create this compute instance. 
    - [ ] When you create a new compute instance through OCI console, you use the default shape to speed up the process to create this compute instance. 
1. You are working as a security consultant with a global insurance organization which Is using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) as Identity provided to manager user login/passwords. When a user logs in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) console. it should get authenticated by Azure AD. 

    Which set of steps are required to configure at OCI side in order to get it enabled 
    - [ ] Setup Azure AD as an Identity Provider, import users and groups from Azure AD to OCI, set up IAM policies to govern access to Azure AD groups
    - [ ] Setup Azure AD as an Enterprise Application, map Azure AD users, groups and policies to OCI groups and users
    - [x] Setup Azure AD as an Identity Provider, map Azure AD groups to OCI groups, set up the IAM policies to govern access to Azure AD groups
    - [ ] Setup Azure AD as an Enterprise Application, configure OCI for single sign-on, map Azure AD groups to OCI groups, set up the IAM policies to govern access to Azure AD groups
    
1. A hospital in Austin has hosted its web based medical records portal entirely In Oracle cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using Compute Instances for its web-tier and DB system database for its data tier. To validate compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA), the security professional to check their systems it was found that there are a lot of unauthorized coming requests coming from a set of IP addresses originating from a country in Southeast Asia. 
Which option can mitigate this type of attack? 
    - [ ] Block the attacking IP address by creating by Network Security Group rule to deny access to the compute Instance where the web server is running 
    - [x] Block the attacking IP address by implemepting a OCI Web Application Firewall policy using Access Control Rules
    - [ ] Mitigate the attack by changing the Route fable to redirect the unauthorized traffic to a dummy Compute instance
    - [ ] Block the attacking IP address by creating a Security List rule to deny access to the subnet where the web server is running
    
1. You are building a highly available and fault tolerant web application deployment for your company. Similar application delayed by competitors experienced web site attack including DDoS which resulted in web server failing. 
You have decided to use Oracle Web Application Firewall (WAF) to implement an architecture which will provide protection against such attacks and ensure additional configuration will you need to implement to make sure WAF is protecting my web application 24x7. 
Which additional configuration will you need to Implement to make sure WAF Is protecting my web application 24x7? 
    - [ ] Configure auto scaling policy and it to WAF instance. 
    - [ ] Configure Control Rules to send traffic to multiple web servers 
    - [x] Configure multiple origin servers 
    - [ ] Configure new rules based on now vulnerabilities and mitigations 
1. A new international hacktivist group, based in London, launched wide scale cyber attacks including SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) across multiple websites which are hosted in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). As an IT consultant you must configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect these websites against the attacks. How should you configure your WAF to protect the website against those attacks? (Choose the best answer.) 
    - [ ] Enable a Protection Rule to block the attacks based on HTTP Headers that contain XSS and SQL strings. 
    - [ ] Enable an Access Rule to block the IP Address range from London. 
    - [x] Enable a Protection Rule to block requests XSS Filters Categories and SQL Filters Categories.
    - [ ] Enable a Protection Rule to block requests that came from London. 
    - [ ] Enable an Access Rule that contains XSS Filters Categories and SQL Filters Categories. 
1. By default, What is the maximum number of security lists that can be associated with a subnet upon creation? 
    - 5
1. When creating a subnet, one or more placeholder security lists are often associated with the subnet. Why? 
    - [ ] Each operator needs its own security list. 
    - [ ] Each protocol needs its own security list. 
    - [x] Each network endpoint or instance in the subnet needs its own security list. 
    - [ ] It is not possible to add or remove security lists after a subnet is created.
