## IAM
1. You are creating an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Dynamic Group. To determine the members of this group you are defining a set of matching rules. Which of the following are the supported variables to define conditions in the matching rules? (Choose Two) 
    - [x] `tag.<tagnamespace>.<tagkey> value` - the tag namespace and tag key

    - [ ] lam.policy.ld - the OCID of the IAM polity to apply to the group. 
1.  You are-working as a security consultant with a global insurance organization which is using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) as identity provider to manage user login/passwords. When a user logs in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) console, it should get authenticated by Azure AD. Which set of steps are required to configure at OCI side in order to get it enabled 
    - [ ] Setup Azure AD as an Identity Provider. Import users and groups from Azure AD to OCI. set up IAM policies to govern access to Azure AD groups
    - [ ] Setup Azure AD as an Enterprise Application, map Azure AD users and groups and policies to OCI groups and users 
    - [x] Setup Azure AD as an Identity Provider, map Azure AD groups to 00 groups, set up the IAM policies to govern access to Azure AD groups
    - [ ] Setup Azure AD as an Enterprise Application, configure OCI for Single sign-on, map Azure AD groups to OCI groups, set up the IAM policies to govern access to Azure AD groups 

1. Your organization is using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and wants to setup a disaster recovery plan by copying block volume backups to another region at regular intervals. This makes it easier to rebuild applications and data in the destination region if a region wide disaster occurs in the source region. Which IAM Policy statement allows the VolumeAdmins group to copy volume backups between regions? (Choose the best answer.) 
    - [ ] Allow group VolumeAdmins to inspect volumesiamily in tenancy 
    - [x] Allow group VolumeAdmins to use backups in tenancy 
    - [ ] Allow group VolumrAdmins to manage volumes in tenancy 
    - [ ] Allow group VolumeAdmins to copy volume-backups in tenancy 

1. By copying block volume backups to another region at regular intervals. it makes it easier for you to rebuild applications and data in the destination region if a region-wide disaster occurs in the source region. 
Which IAM Policy statement allows the VolumeAdmins group to copy volume backups between regions 
    - [ ] Allow group VolumeAdmins to use volumes in tenancy 
    - [ ] Allow group VolumeAdmins to copy volume backups in tenancy 
    - [x] Allow group VolumeAdmins to manage volume-family In tenancy 
    - [ ] Allow group VolumeAdmins to inspect volumes in tenancy Answer 

## Cost and Budget

1. Multiple departments In your company use a shared Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) tenancy to Implement their projects. You are in charge of managing the cost of OCI resources in the tenancy and need to obtain better Insights Into department's usage. Which three options can you implement together to accomplish this? 
    - [x] Create a budget that matchers your commitment amount and an alert at 100 percent of the forecast
    - [ ] Use the billing cost tracking report to analyze costs. 
    - [ ] Set up a consolidated budget tracking tags to analyze costs in granular manner
    - [x] Set up different compartments for each department then track and analyze cost per compartment
    - [x] Set up a tag default that automatically applies tags to all specified resources created In a compartment then use these tags for cost analysis. 

## Compartment and Tag
1. You have multiple IAM users who launch different types of compute Instances and block volumes every day. As a result, your Oracle cloud Infrastructure (OCF) tenancy quickly hit the service limit and you can no longer create any new instances. As you are cleaning up environment, you notice that the majority of the Instances and block volumes are untagged. Therefore, It is difficult to pinpoint the owner of these resources verify if they are safe to terminate. Because of this, your company has issued a new mandate, which requires adding compute instances. Which option is the simplest way to implement this new requirement? 
    - [ ] Create a policy to automatically tag a resource with the user name. 
    - [ ] Create a policy using IAM requiring users to tag specific resources. This will allow a user to launch compute instances onw if certain tags were defined. 
    - [x] Create tag variables to automatically tag a resource with the user name. 
    - [ ] Create_a default tag for each compartment, which ensure that appropriate tags are applied at resource creation 
    - [ ] Create tag variables for each compartment to automatically tag a resource with the user name.

1. You have deployed a multi-tier application with multiple compute instances in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. You want to back up these volumes and have decided to use Volume Group's feature. The Block volume and Compute instances exist in different compartments within your tenancy. 
Periodically. a few child compartments are moved under different parent compartments. and you notice that sometimes volume group backup fails. 
What could be the cause ? 
    - [ ] You have the same block volume attached to multiple compute instances: if these compute Instances are in different compartments then all concerned compartments must be moved at the same time. 
    - [ ] You are exceeding your volume group backup quota configured. 
    - [x] The Identity and Access Management policy allowing backup failed to move when the compartment was moved. 
    - [ ] compute instance With multiple block volumes attached cannot move when a compartment moved.

1. Your customer has gone through a recent departmental re-structure. As part Of this change, they are organizing their Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) compartment structure to align with the company's new organizational structure. They have made the following change: <image> Compartment x Is moved, and its parent compartment is now compartment c. Policy defined in compartment A: Allow group networkadmins to manage subnets in compartment X Policy defined in root compartment: Allow group admins to read subnets in compartment Finance A:X After compartment move, which action will provide users of group networkadmins and admins with similar privileges as before the move? 
    - [x] Define a policy in Compartment C as follows: Allow group networkadmins to manage subnets in compartment x 
    - [ ] Define a policy in C as follows: Allow group admins to read subnets in compartment FIR: C:X 
    - [ ] Define a policy in HR as follows: Allow group networkadmins to manage subnets in compartment X Define a policy in C as follows : Allow group admins to read in HR: c:x 
    - [ ] NO change in any policy statement is required as compartments move automatically moves all the policy statements associated With compartments as well. 
1. You are trying to delete a compartment. The delete operation is falling and you need to troubleshoot the problem. VVhich step should NOT be considered when troubleshooting this issue? 
    - [x] Verify that there are no policies In the root compartment that reference the compartment you are trying to delete. 
    - [ ] Verify that you have removed all resources from the compaiment. 
    - [ ] Make sure you have at least one more compartment in your tenancy other than the root compartment. 
    - [ ] Search for resources in the compartment for each region that your tenancy is subscribed to.
