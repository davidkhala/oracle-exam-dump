1. You work for a German company as the Lead Oracle Cloud Infrastructure architect. You have designed a highly scalable architecture for your company's business critical application which uses the Load Balancer service auto which uses the Load Balancer service, auto-scaling configuration for the application servers and a 2 Node VM Oracle RAC database. During the peak utilization period of the-application you noticed that the application is running slow and customers are complaining. This is resulting in support tickets being created for API timeouts and negative sentiment from the customer base. What are two possible reasons for this application slowness?
